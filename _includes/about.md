## About Us
We are a Kyudo club based in the Seattle metro area. Our club is recognized by the [American Kyudo Renmei (AKF)](https://www.kyudousa.com/), [All Nippon Kyudo Renmei (ANKF)](https://www.kyudo.jp/info/english.html), and the [International Kyudo Federation (IKYF)](https://www.ikyf.org/).

We offer lessons in Kyudo, a traditional form of Japanese Archery. We practice in the Bellevue area 2-4 hours every weekend.

**We are currently taking new students ages 18 and above. We will take the next batch of students starting August 1st, 2024.**
