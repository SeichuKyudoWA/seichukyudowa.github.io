## About Us
We are a Kyudo club based in the Seattle metro area. We offer lessons in Kyudo, a traditional form of Japanese Archery. We practice in the Bellevue area 2-4 hours every weekend.

**We are currently taking new students ages 18 and above through June 30, 2024.**

Note: The site is currently under construction. Please check back periodically for updates. In the mean time, check out our [Links](#links) section for some information about Kyudo!
