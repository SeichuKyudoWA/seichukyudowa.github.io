## About Us
We are a Kyudo club based in the Seattle metro area. Our club is recognized by the [American Kyudo Renmei (AKF)](https://www.kyudousa.com/), [All Nippon Kyudo Renmei (ANKF)](https://www.kyudo.jp/info/english.html), and the [International Kyudo Federation (IKYF)](https://www.ikyf.org/).

We offer lessons in Kyudo, a traditional form of Japanese Archery. All lessons are taught in English with terminology specific to Kyudo in Japanese. We practice in the Bellevue area 2 - 3 hours every weekend.

**Next viewing and enrollment dates will start in April 2025. Please give us a call or email us for more details.**
