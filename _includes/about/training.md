A typical class includes 1 hour group instruction and individual coaching on movement, standing, walking, sitting, bowing while handling the bow and arrows and 1 hour of group shooting practice with individual coaching. The 3rd hour is free practice with instructors assisting individualsâ€™ particular needs.
