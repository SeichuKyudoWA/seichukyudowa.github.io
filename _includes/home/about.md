## About Us
We are a Kyudo club based in the Seattle metro area. Our club is recognized by the [American Kyudo Renmei (AKF)](https://www.kyudousa.com/), [All Nippon Kyudo Renmei (ANKF)](https://www.kyudo.jp/info/english.html), and the [International Kyudo Federation (IKYF)](https://www.ikyf.org/).

We offer lessons in Kyudo, a traditional form of Japanese Archery. All lessons are taught in English with terminology specific to Kyudo in Japanese. We practice in the Bellevue area from 9AM to 12PM every Sunday.

**We will be taking our next set of students on 4/27. Please call or email us for availability!**
