## Mission Statement

Our objective aligns with that of the International Kyudo Federation:

> Through kyudo, as a part of traditional Japanese culture, IKYF shall endeavor to promote the
> forming of character through the pursuit of the highest ideals of kyudo (Shin (truth), Zen (goodness) and
> Bi (beauty). Further to this, IKYF shall contribute to the worldwide promotion of kyudo and the
> establishment of a peaceful society, and to the cultivation of trust and friendship among its Member
> Organizations.
>
> -- <cite>[The Constitution of the International Kyudo Federation](https://www.ikyf.org/pdf/constitution_201506.pdf), Chapter 2, Article 6</cite>

To add to this, our goal is for you to have *fun*. We want you to experience the joy of hitting the target, improving your form, and joining a community of like-minded people.

## Training Progression Timeline

Traditionally, beginners in Kyudo progress through the following steps. The guides and videos that are linked are only samples and there may be differences in the way that we will do it than what you may see through those mediums.

<dl><dt>Step 1) Toshu (徒手) training</dt></dl>
- Beginners will first start out by practicing the basic form of shooting in Kyudo, the [Shahou-Hassetsu](https://ikyf.org/shahouhassetsu.html) (射法八節), without any equipment.
<dl><dt>Step 2) <a href="https://www.kyudo.jp/improve/">Training with the gomu yumi (ゴム弓)</a></dt></dl>
- At this stage, you will now practice the shahou-hassetsu using the gomu yumi. This will help you develop consistent form by mimicing the forces that may act on you when you draw and release a real bow.
<dl><dt>Step 3) <a href="https://www.kyudo.jp/improve/02.html">Subiki (素引き) training</a></dt></dl>
- This step will have you practice the shahou-hassetsu using a real bow without releasing the string. This will give you a taste of the actual forces that act upon your body when you start to shoot and teach you the fundamentals of the tenouchi (手の内) for Kyudo. It must be said that you must NEVER dry-fire a bow at full draw, as you could cause irrepairable damage to the bow.
<dl><dt>Step 4) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gu22bnCGHY">Makiwara (巻藁) training</a></dt></dl>
- This is the final step before beginners actually start shooting at targets. You will learn how to nock an arrow and release it in a more controlled environment.

While it may seem like a linear progression, in reality you will revisit every single one of these steps multiple times in your journey through Kyudo. At the Seichu Kyudo Club, we will have you bounce between steps 1 and 2, then steps 1 and 3, before we have you progress to step 4.
